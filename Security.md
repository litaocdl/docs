Some IT Compliance:

SOX: is a financial regulation in the U.S. that applies to a broad spectrum of industries.  
PCI-DSS: are a group of security regulations that protect consumer privacy when personal credit card information is transmitted, stored, and processed by businesses.  
ISO-27001: on the other hand, is not a law but a standard that companies can opt into by aligning with these InfoSec standards.
SoC2: is auditing procedure  that ensures your service providers securely manage your data to protect the interests of your organization and the privacy 
of its clients. For security-conscious businesses, SOC 2 compliance is a minimal requirement when considering a SaaS provider.
